# Delta Lake Game Jam 2023
It's game jam time again. We have a new theme and including not one but two open source game engines you can use to create your killer game in 48 hours.

## Theme
This game jam has a required theme. This time, it's Delta Lake,  an open-source storage framework that enables building a Lakehouse architecture with compute engines including Spark, PrestoDB, Flink, Trino, and Hive and APIs for Scala, Java, Rust, Ruby, and Python.


## Game Engine(s)
For this game jam, you can choose to use either [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/) or [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). Both are amazing open-source game engines and have phenomenal communities!

## Prizes
This time, we are doing Winner Takes All. The winner will receive a $500 Visa gift card and showcased at a booth at the [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x) (SCALE) in Pasadena, CA on March 9 - 12, 2023.

Delta Lake is an open-source storage framework that enables building a Lakehouse architecture with compute engines including Spark, PrestoDB, Flink, Trino, and Hive and APIs for Scala, Java, Rust, Ruby, and Python. You can learn more about it at https://github.com/delta-io/delta. 


### Q. Well that sounds really technical...why did you choose this theme?
Because there is an amazing community of amateur game developers that have day jobs as data engineers and solution architects that work with Delta Lake. We are a huge supporter of Delta Lake, open-source, and generally anything that is awesome.

To be eligible for the prizes and associated bragging rights, yes you do.

Yes. It's open source goodness. And learning new things is awesome.
